Bitcore Node ZelCash
============

A ZelCash full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Explorer Guide
### Part 1. Zelcash with extended RPC functionalities
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheTrunk/bitcore-node-zelcash/installZelcashd.sh | bash
```
### Part 2. Latest Zelcash insight explorer = bitcore-node-zelcash with insight-api and insight-ui
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheTrunk/bitcore-node-zelcash/installExplorer.sh | bash
```
## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheTrunk/bitcore-node-zelcash.git
cd bitcore-node-zelcash
npm install
bitcore-node start
```

## Prerequisites

- GNU/Linux x86_32/x86_64, or OSX 64bit *(for zelcashd distributed binaries)*
- Node.js v0.10, v0.12 or v4
- ZeroMQ *(libzmq3-dev for Ubuntu/Debian or zeromq on OSX)*

## Configuration

Bitcore includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing, configuring and interfacing with your Bitcore Node.

```bash
bitcore-node create -d <bitcoin-data-dir> mynode
cd mynode
bitcore-node install <service>
bitcore-node install https://github.com/yourname/helloworld
```

This will create a directory with configuration files for your node and install the necessary dependencies. For more information about (and developing) services, please see the [Service Documentation](docs/services.md).
